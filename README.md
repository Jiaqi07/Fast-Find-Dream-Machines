hahahahah brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr skeet description go brrr who need hahahahaha - Me when i was stupid during 8th grade

This is the Fast Find Prototype that I coded ALONE(sad about that, really boring and time consuming) for our FTC group, Dream Machine #16548. It was pretty decent I must say. We went to globals for First Innovation and sadly lost there but hey, Globals is really good for middle schoolers. I think I played a key part in this team and I really appreciate the members and the coach for helping me reach that goal even though some didn't help at all... Sigh. 8/13/2021 - Alan C. Worked on this during Last semester of COVID 8th grade through Summer.
